I have been losing my wifi connection a lot lately with wpa_supplicant exiting with

    wpa_supplicant[474]: wlp2s0: CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED bssid=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx reason=4 locally_generated=1

I found a list of [wpa_supplicant reason codes]() that claims reason 4 means *Disassociated due to inactivity*. The connection is certainly not idle when I lose my connectivity, so maybe some connectivity check is failing.

So I enable debugging in NetworkManager by writing to `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-defaults.conf`:

    [logging]
    level=DEBUG

Then I run `journalctl -u NetworkManager -f` before restarting NetworkManager with `systemctl restart NetworkManager` and start watching the logs. The first thing I see is what configuration files are being read:

    <info>  [1490522215.5734] Read config: /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (lib: 20-connectivity.conf) (etc: 00-defaults.conf, 10-powersaving.conf

The `lib: 20-connectivity.conf` seems interesting. `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/20-connectivity.conf` contains the following:

    [connectivity]
    uri=http://www.archlinux.org/check_network_status.txt

But the logs says its fine:

    NetworkManager[30021]: <debug> [1490522524.6651] connectivity: check: send periodic request to 'http://www.archlinux.org/check_network_status.txt'
    NetworkManager[30021]: <debug> [1490522524.7821] connectivity: check for uri 'http://www.archlinux.org/check_network_status.txt' successful.

... which I can confirm by reading the CONNECTIVITY SECTION of `man NetworkManager.conf`

    $ curl http://www.archlinux.org/check_network_status.txt
    NetworkManager is online

So on to the next possible explanations. Someone is proposing it could be due to wifi scanning taking place, pausing network traffic while the scan is in progress. <https://blogs.gnome.org/dcbw/2016/05/16/networkmanager-and-wifi-scans/>

## Start from scratch

After changing laptop a while back, I used unedited connection profiles from `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`. This may have been causing issues with invalid connection UIDS and device hardware addresses. I just deleted all my connections and I'm re-creating them from scratch. Let's see if it helps.


To be continued... Please comment with suggestions if you have any!
