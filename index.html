      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an independent software developer and system operator who loves to
        program. I enjoy learning new things and to tinker with computers and

        I have 10 years of professional experience writing and running
        commercial web-sites and applications, all across the stack.
        My main focus right now is on Go, Python, Node.js and test-driven
        development (TDD) in general.

        Leading the move of multiple micro-services from plain Docker
        deployments into Kubernetes (AKS) for a sensor data storage,
        aggregation and AI system. Adapting programs to work together smoothly,
        log properly, die when fatally failing, respond to signals, break free
        from their persistent state, and otherwise facilitating their
        individual scalability.<br>
