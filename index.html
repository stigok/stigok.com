      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an independent software developer and system operator.
        I love learning new things and to tinker with computers and
        programming. Improving every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus right now is on Golang, Python, Node.js and test-driven
        development (TDD).

        Reviewed a Golang project's code base and its deployment platform and
        setup to make sure it adhered to best practices, security guidelines,
        and validating the functionality of the architecture.<br>

        Leading the move of multiple micro-services from plain Docker
        deployments into Kubernetes (AKS) for a sensor data storage,
        aggregation and AI system. Adapting programs to work together smoothly,
        log properly, die when fatally failing, respond to signals, break free
        from their persistent state, and otherwise facilitating their
        individual scalability.<br>

        Developed an image detection system for a marketing company to filter
        images picturing a collage. It saved them from the tedious task of
        manually going through submitted and scraped image content for their
        picture recommendation service.<br>

        Creating an independent online ordering system for take-away food for
        several Oslo restaurants, giving them a more cost-effective alternative
        compared to the biggest take-away courier companies. Orders go from the
        customer's phone to the kitchen printer.<br>
