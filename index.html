        My main focus right now is on Golang, Python, Node.js and test-driven
        development (TDD).

        Leading the move of multiple micro-services from plain Docker
        deployments into Kubernetes (AKS) for a sensor-data storage,
        aggregation and AI system. Adapting programs to work together
        in a container environment, to log properly, die when fatally
        failing, respond to signals, break free from their persistent
        state, and otherwise facilitating their individual scalability.<br>

        Developed an image analysis program to detect images that are combined
        into a collage. Through down-sampling, color-reduction and raw pixel
        analysis, these kinds of images were identified.
        It saved the customer from the tedious task of manually classifying
        submitted and scraped image content for their picture recommendation
        service.<br>

        Reviewed a Golang project's code base and its deployment platform to
        make sure it adhered to best practices, following security guidelines
        and validating the functionality of the architecture.<br>

        Creating an independent online ordering system for take-away food for
        several Oslo restaurants, giving them a more cost-effective alternative
        compared to the biggest take-away courier companies. Orders go from the
        customer's phone to the kitchen printer.<br>

        Developed an interactive single-page application (SPA) to help a
        company match specific customer criterias with their large set of
        products. In collaboration with a graphical designer, I created
        a statically built web-site that works responsively across different
        devices and screen sizes, with focus on UX and usability.
