      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an independent software developer and system operator who loves to program.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have 10 years of professional experience writing and running
        commercial web-sites and applications, all across the stack. I enjoy
        learning new things and to tinker with computers and programming.
        My main focus right now is on Go, Python, Node.js and test-driven
        development (TDD) in general.
        I have experience with, and am especially eager to join, projects that
        leverage working with Kubernetes and/or Apache Kafka.
