        <p>
          Led the move of multiple micro-services from plain Docker
          deployments into Kubernetes (AKS) for a sensor-data storage,
          aggregation and AI-supported system. Adapted programs to work
          together in a container environment, log properly, die when fatally
          failing, respond to signals, break free from persistent state,
          and otherwise facilitating their individual scalability.<br>

        </p>
        --
        <p>
          Developed an image analysis program to detect images that were combined
          into collages. Through down-sampling, color-reduction and raw pixel
          analysis, these images were identified.<br>

          Reviewed a Golang project's code base and its deployment platform to
          ensure it adhered to best practices, followed security guidelines
          and validated the intended functionality of the solution.<br>

          Created an independent online ordering system for take-away food for
          several Oslo based restaurants, giving them a more cost-effective
          alternative compared to the biggest take-away courier companies.
          Orders go from the customer's phone to the kitchen printers.<br>

          Developed an interactive single-page application (SPA) to help
          match customer criterias with a large set of products.
          In collaboration with a graphical designer, we created
          a highly interactive, statically built web-site, that worked
          responsively across multiple devices and screen sizes, with
          focus on UX and usability.<br>
